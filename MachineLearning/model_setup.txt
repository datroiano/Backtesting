Training model based on the following variables:

DEP: After-commission/transaction cost, before-tax profit/loss

IND VARS (assuming day trade):
- Entry time
- Exit time
- Δ Measured Transactions
- Δ Trading Volume (contracts, not underlying)
- Stock correlation (asb Δ stock price in time measured)

Issues / ideas / assumptions:
1. Entry/exit time may change non-independently with Δ transactions & Δ trading volume
    - Possible solution: omit Δ transactions and Δ trading volume

CASE 1 TEST:

DEP: After-commission/transaction cost, before-tax profit/loss

IND VARS (assuming day trade):
- Entry time (seconds since midnight, not unix)
- Exit time (seconds since midnight, not unix)
- Stock correlation (asb Δ stock price in time measured)

Training the model:
- Will attempt to find examples where stock price is relatively constant from entry to exit time ~0.05% movement.
